# Companies to apply to

Disclaimer: I have curated this list based upon my goals + where I see my career going. I don't think this is a full proof list anyone else should really copy but I am sure there will be some overlap with whom we apply to so feel free to use this to your advantage! It also isnt in any particular order, I sort of just add them as I find them from various articles or personal conversations. To illustrate this point, companies like Amazon, Discord, and Bloomber are my top priorities but are somewhere in the middle of the list just because I found others to put on this list first.
